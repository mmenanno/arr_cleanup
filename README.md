# Setup database
bin/rails db:setup

# Start the development server
bin/dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Configuration

## Development

### Running the App

```bash
# Start all services (web, CSS, background jobs)
bin/dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
bin/rails test
```

### Database Tasks

```bash
# Clear all sync statuses
bin/rails sync:clear_status

# Clear cable messages
bin/rails cable:clear
```

## Architecture

### Real-Time Updates

The app uses Hotwire (Turbo Streams + Action Cable) for real-time updates:

- **Solid Cable** adapter in development/production for cross-process broadcasting
- **Turbo Streams** for granular DOM updates
- **Stimulus controllers** for interactive UI components

### Background Jobs

- **Solid Queue** processes sync jobs in the background
- Jobs update progress every 5 items for smooth UI updates
- Automatic retry with polynomial backoff on errors

### Design System

**Color Coding:**

- **Indigo/Blue** - Movies and Radarr
- **Purple** - Shows and Sonarr
- **Yellow/Orange** - Storage and system info
- **Red** - REMUX warnings
- **Green** - Success and standard quality

**Gradients:**

- Subtle 5-10% opacity gradients throughout
- Color-coded by service for instant recognition
- Modern, polished aesthetic

## API Integration

### Radarr

- Fetches all movies via `/api/v3/movie`
- Gets movie details and file information
- Detects REMUX quality files

### Sonarr

- Fetches all series via `/api/v3/series`
- Gets episodes via `/api/v3/episode`
- Gets episode files via `/api/v3/episodefile`
- Maps episodes to files for complete information
